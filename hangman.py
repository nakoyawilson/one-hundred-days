#Testing code

#TODO-1: - Create an empty List called display.
#For each letter in the chosen_word, add a "_" to 'display'.
#So if the chosen_word was "apple", display should be ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"] with 5 "_" representing each letter to guess.

# Ask the user to guess a letter and assign their answer to a variable called guess. Make guess lowercase.

#TODO-2: - Loop through each position in the chosen_word;
#If the letter at that position matches 'guess' then reveal that letter in the display at that position.
#e.g. If the user guessed "p" and the chosen word was "apple", then display should be ["_", "p", "p", "_", "_"].

# Check if the letter the user guessed (guess) is one of the letters in the chosen_word.
if guess in chosen_word:
    # Reveal letter
    pass
else:
    # Lose a life
    pass

# TODO-3: - Print 'display' and you should see the guessed letter in the correct position and every other letter replace with "_".
# Hint - Don't worry about getting the user to guess the next letter. We'll tackle that in step 3.
